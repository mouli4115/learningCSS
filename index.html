        <p class="text">
            Hello, My name is Mouli and I am just an avid consumer of popular storytelling mediums like novels, films,
            manga, anime, tv shows and graphic novels.
            <br>
            <br>
            Stories can also evoke feelings within us, whether we know the individual or not. Good stories can make us
            feel excitement, anger, sadness, empathy, or enthusiasm. Our emotional reaction can mean we feel something
            towards the person telling the story, which helps create connection.
            <br><br>This is a list of my favourite pieces of storytelling.

        </div>
        <p class="text">
            In the waves of steam and machinery, who could achieve extraordinary? In the fogs of history and darkness,
            who was whispering? I woke up from the realm of mysteries and opened my eyes to the world.

            Firearms, cannons, battleships, airships, and difference machines. Potions, divination, curses, hanged-man,
            and sealed artifacts‚Ä¶ The lights shone brightly, yet the secrets of the world were never far away.
            <br>
            <br>
            This was a legend of the ‚ÄúFool‚Äù.

        </div>
        <p class="text">
            A novel called Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World (written by the anonymous author tls123) has been
            written and published over the course of a decade, and Kim Dokja is the sole reader who has followed it to
            its ending. <br> <br> When the real world is plunged into the premise of Ways of Survival, Kim Dokja's
            unique knowledge of the novel becomes vital to his survival. Kim Dokja allies with Yoo Joonghyuk, the
            protagonist of Ways of Survival, in order to change the novel's original plot and more quickly approach the
            end of the story. <br> <br> As Kim Dokja and his party members progress through the scenarios, they face
            increasingly difficult threats and life-or-death challenges, struggling to stay alive and work together as
            they aim to destroy the Star Stream that demands their suffering.

            <h2 class="desc">GINTAMA</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Edo is a city that was home to the vigor and ambition of samurai across the country. However, following
            feudal Japan's surrender to powerful aliens known as the "Amanto," those aspirations now seem unachievable.
            With the once-influential shogunate rebuilt as a puppet government, a new law is passed that promptly
            prohibits all swords in public.
            <br><br>
            Enter Gintoki Sakata, an eccentric silver-haired man who always carries around a wooden sword and maintains
            his stature as a samurai despite the ban. As the founder of Yorozuya, a small business for odd jobs, Gintoki
            often embarks on endeavors to help other people‚Äîthough usually in rather strange and unforeseen ways.
            <br><br>
            Assisted by Shinpachi Shimura, a boy with glasses supposedly learning the way of the samurai; Kagura, a
            tomboyish girl with superhuman strength and an endless appetite; and Sadaharu, their giant pet dog who loves
            biting on people's heads, the Yorozuya encounter anything from alien royalty to scuffles with local gangs in
            the ever-changing world of Edo.

            <h2 class="desc">TOKYO GHOUL</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            A sinister threat is invading Tokyo: flesh-eating "ghouls" who appear identical to humans and blend into
            their population. Reserved college student Ken Kaneki buries his nose in books and avoids the news of the growing crisis. However, the appearance of an attractive woman named Rize Kamishiro shatters his solitude
            when she forwardly asks him on a date.
         <br> <br>
            While walking Rize home, Kaneki discovers she isn't as kind as she first appeared, and she has led him on
            with sinister intent. After a tragic struggle, he later awakens in a hospital to learn his life was saved by
            transplanting the now deceased Rize's organs into his own body.
<br><br>
            Kaneki's body begins to change in horrifying ways, and he transforms into a human-ghoul hybrid. As he
            embarks on his new dreadful journey, Kaneki clings to his humanity in the evolving bloody conflict between
            society's new monsters and the government agents who hunt them.
